# Introduction

This blog is under development. Please come back later.


## Comparing ML and Statistics

Machine learning is used to solve unsupervised and supervised learning problems. For supervised learning, their primary purpose are to provide predictions for regression and classification problems but are often expanded to gain interpretable insights about the data against the target. Meanwhile, statistics is used to infer a probability distribution about the data.

Tips when working with Probabilistic programming:

Claimed to help with Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling. Gelman suggests rescaling by 2 standard deviations when working with binary untransformed predictors.
 
This is to allow features to be within the same scale of 0 to 1. This makes the multiple regression coefficients on the same scale as correlations. Gelman said “you can interpret the coefficient as the number of standard deviation changes in y that correspond to a 1 standard deviation change in x.”
 
The paper was written back in 2009. The authors claim that scaling features by dividing by 2 standard deviations helps with linear regression models and provide coefficients that are easily interpretable because it makes the coefficients directly comparable to binary predictors.

Black box vs Probabilistic Programming
 
Opaque inference, constrained models and uncertainty – Black model ML
Like a play mobile kit where you can only build a certain number of things
 
Clear inference extreme flexibility and full uncertainty – probabilistic programming
Like a whole bunch of lego pieces where the possibilities are endless
Nowadays it is easy to build a custom Bayesian model and get back probabilities based from our data.

Customize and tailor model while incorporating expert domain knowledge
Probabilistic programming is getting faster and starting scale more. This is because the Monte-Carlo algorithms (NUTS algorithm)
Bayesian is great for smaller datasets because we can incorporate priors (i.e. domain knowledge)
 
Bayesian Modelling works best:
- When not a simple prediction problem.
- Gain insight into the data
- Structured data (i.e. hierarchical, time series,…)
- Integrate domain knowledge into models as priors.
- Uncertainty plays an important role
 
It is difficult to establish when a ML model is bad, espcially if you don’t have a thorough understanding of the metrics (RMSE, AUC, ROC etc.) or how your model works. Whereas the Bayesian model will very clearly show you when the model is poor. This can be seen by looking at whether or not the model has converged or not. Bayesian models are generative
 
Frequentist and Bayesian models both produce
 
Note: “computational problems often means there’s a problem with your model”  said by Gelman 2008.
 
PyMC 4.0 has better scalability: JAX and Numbda backend, GPU support
