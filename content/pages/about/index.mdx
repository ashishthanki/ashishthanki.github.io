Welcome to my Blog!

My name is Ashish Thanki and I am a Data Scientist!

This website will showcase my work, give insights into Data Science and hopefully allow you to learn a few things along the way. If you are an aspiring Data Scientist then this is the right blog for you, and if you are just dipping your toes in the data world then, again, this is the right blog for you. For all those non-technical folks, you'll find that the articles will be short enough yet sufficiently technical to increase your competence in the subject; while also taking you a step closer on preparing you for your interview, conversation or meeting! 

My preferred programming language is Python, probably biased due to the line of field I am in, so most articles will be based around this language. Yet, some articles will also be written in the language of Mathematics - so I am guessing Greek? From experience, understanding the Mathematics behind Machine Learning algorithms, statistics & probabilities and Computer Science will help significantly in your projects. So let us begin, go ahead and click on the blobs section.

Please feel free to contact me on the numerous social media platforms by clicking on the links at the top right hand corner. 



P.S. I am happy to write a blog on any subject that is on demand!
